## dev-ops  


### part one  
This is a very simple JavaFX application that stores data about master classers and is used for two assignements. The first assigment is a operator simulation, attendees of the copurse have figure out why a thread in the background can not  upload master classer data  through a CSV interface after a while. Afterwards they have to discuss why it was easy or hard to solve the assignment and what can be done to easier find why a problem like this occurs.

### part two  
In the second assignenet attendees have to team up again and write new code for the application. At the same time a production problem is simulated which the teams have to solve. They have to think how to divide their rescources between the production problem and the writing of new features.


Each new feature assignment should have corresponding (J)unit tests. Futurempore it should be documented better than the existing code./

The unit test can be found under the /src/test map in the code, and is accompanied with previously inserted   
//TODO comments.
